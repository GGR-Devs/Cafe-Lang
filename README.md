# Cafe-Lang
Here you can find every cafe language string, since the original game had plenty of translation errors, you may help re-translate the game to have proper translations :)

# IMPORTANT!
Please change the end-of-line character from CLRF (Windows) to LF (Unix) because files are commited in LF.
You can easiy do in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org "Notepad++ (sometimes npp or NPP), is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows").

If you not change it, the entire file will be replaced.
Commits containing CRLF will be automatically rejected and closed without being merged.
